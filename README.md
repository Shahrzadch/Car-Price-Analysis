# Car-Price-Analysis
Generating car price prediction model using regression analysis (stepwise and LASSO regression)
The problem statement of this project is to understand and characterize factors that affect the final selling price of a vehicle. To achieve this objective, a dataset from an automobile company which is looking to sell vehicles in the United States is used. The used dataset includes data collected from 205 vehicles. The data contain price of cars as well as 25 explanatory variables, including 11 categorical and 14 numeric variables. The explanatory variables range from simple attributes, such as makes and models of vehicles, highway miles per gallon, as well as more advanced features, such as bore ratio. The goal of the analysis is to understand the data, to determine significant variables, and finally to build a reliable model that can help the company to predict selling prices of vehicles. Therefore, in the model, carprice (USD) is the response variable and within 25 explanatory variables, the significant predictors are explored and selected.
